# Queue_TwoStacks
Queue using Two Stacks
 basic queue has the following operations:

Enqueue: add a new element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.
In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then process  queries, where each query is one of the following  types:

1 x: Enqueue element  into the end of the queue.
2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3: Print the element at the front of the queue.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of queries.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single query in the form described in the problem statement above. All three queries start with an integer denoting the query , but only query  is followed by an additional space-separated value, , denoting the value to be enqueued.

Constraints

It is guaranteed that a valid answer always exists for each query of type 3.
Output Format

For each query of type 3, print the value of the element at the front of the queue on a new line.
